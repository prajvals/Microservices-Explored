2. Tech Used: **Spring Boot**, **Java**, **PostMan**, **Eureka Service Registry**, **Eureka Client**, **Zipkin And Sleuth**,**MySQL**, Lombok.

3. Prominent Features Include: 

     - Microservices Driven Architecture 
     - API Gateway Implemented
     - Eureka Service Registry
     - Eureka Client 
     - Client Side Loadbalancing
     - Distributed Logging using Zipkin And Sleuth.
     - MySQL database
     - Cross Services Interactions
     - Centralised Configurations Service to store Eureka Client Configurations to connect to Eureka Server.
     
4. Tech Used: 
    
    1. IntellJ idea Ultimate Edition.
    2. Eureka Service Discovery
    3. Zipkin And Sleuth for Distributed Logging
    4. MySQL database.
    5. Github for Version Control.
    6. Lombok Library for AutoCode Generation
    7. Loggers.
    8. PostMan.
    9. Spring Boot.
    10. Maven Dependency Manager
    11. Java 8


## STEPS TO RUN 

1. Clone the repo, and open in IntellJ Idea, or any preferred Ide.
2. Start With running the Service Registry Service First, as this Service acts as the Eureka Server
3. After this Start the Config Server, this service Fetches Configurations from Github, and is used by other service to connect to the Eureka Server.
4. Start the Gateway Service, User Service, Department Service.
5. Hit the API using Postman.
 
 ## LEARNINGS AND EXPERIENCE.
 
 The Project was a good learning exercise that helped understand:
 
 1. How Spring Boot Works
 2. How Microservices Architecture Works.
 3. How Cross Services Communication Works
 4. How API Gateway.
 5. How To Structure Spring Boot Applications.
 6. How to Connect to Database using Spring Boot.
